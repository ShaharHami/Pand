The assignment:

First and foremost - I grew up playing Pang so I was very excited to do this assignement and had a lot off fun, maybe even a little too much..
IMPORTANT: I am in no way or form an artist. I can't do art to save my life, so all the art in this game is strictly a placeholder (audio, visuals). Don't judge the art :)
All of the assets I used are free for use, most of them free for commercial use. 

Extra credit tasks:
I chose these tasks because I just feel like a game should be, well, a game. It should have levels and increasing difficulty, nice visuals and audio ( I wish I had time to introduce some particle effects), and the two player local multiplayer was a nice challange.

2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty +++
3. Custom visuals and shaders ++
4. Custom soundtracks and SFX +
5. Two-player, same screen local multiplayer ++

As for architecture - I did not adhere to the MVC paradigm all the time, it's more of a freestyle data driven OOP design.

Thank you for this task. Even if you decide this is not good enough - I had a great time and learned a lot.
I would also appreciate any technical notes, remarks, errors I may have (most probably) made, even a brief code review.

Bonus:
Part of my research process
